//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// BFS searches closest nodes

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
// BFS as DFS will take too long

//If the tree is very wide:
// DFS as BFS will need too much memory

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// DFS faster

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
// BFS
